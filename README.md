# Pixel Manipulation Image Encryption Tool

## Overview

This project was developed during my internship at Prodigy Infotech. The tool is designed to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel manipulation techniques. It employs operations like swapping pixel values and applying basic mathematical operations to each pixel to secure the image data.

## Features

- **Image Encryption**: Encrypts images by manipulating pixel values.
- **Image Decryption**: Restores the original image by reversing the encryption process.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows users to easily upload, encrypt, and decrypt images.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) for image processing
  - `tkinter` for the graphical user interface

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pixel-manipulation-encryption-tool.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd pixel-manipulation-encryption-tool
```

### Usage

1. Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to upload an image, encrypt it, and then decrypt it.
